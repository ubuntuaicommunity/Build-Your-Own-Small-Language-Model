# GDM Lab Series – Statistical Language Models & N-Gram Foundations

This repository contains four practical labs introducing the foundations of **probability**, **n-gram language models**, **dataset preparation**, and the comparison between **classical statistical models** and **modern transformer-based models**.  
These labs form part of a foundational module on **Generative Data Modelling (GDM)**.
